## Dark mode using context

- We have an application with dark/light mode
- In this example we are passing data using props
- To make this applicationw work we are passing data on multiple level
- You have to convert this application to use Context API to share data
- Context will solve the problem of passing data using props again and again
- Make sure to make the application work in the same as it workin now
