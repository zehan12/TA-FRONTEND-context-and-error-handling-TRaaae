## Refact to use Higher Order Component

- In this app there are three pages `Articles`, `People` and `Books`
- All three pages contains list of articles, people and books along with a search functionality
- If you look closely you will understand the behaviour of search function is same in all three pages.

- Create a component `SearchWrapper` using which you will be able to add the search function to any compoent
- After refactoring make sure to check if aell the functionalities are working properly
